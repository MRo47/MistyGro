# Circuit design

The Easy EDA project file (*.zip) and schematics are included in the [Circuit](../Circuit) directory.

1. Circuit was designed in Easy EDA and got manufactured from [JLCPcb](https://jlcpcb.com/)
2. Parts were purchased and soldered by hand, the BOM for which is in [BOM](../BOM/)
3. The switch for misters was not used but simply the terminals were selected for normally open position of the relay.
4. The ESP32 is mounted on 2 single row 0.1" female pin headers (makes it easy to replace the ESP32 if its damaged).
5. Connectors were crimped for power, temperature sensor and LDR and then connected to the circuit.
