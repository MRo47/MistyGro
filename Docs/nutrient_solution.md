# Preparing nutrient solution

## Requirements

- [Masterblend 4-18-38](<https://hydroponicseuro.com/product/masterblend-4-18-38-hydroponic-fertilizer-set-2/?attribute_weight=1.5+kg>) which comes with Magnesium sulphate and Calcium Nitrate.
- [Potassium carbonate](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/224519112465?var=523793464566)
- Distilled water, rainwater or water under ppm of 200 should be used to make the nutrient solution

## Steps

1. Masterblend 4-18-38 was used as the nutrient solution and purchased from [here](https://hydroponicseuro.com/product/masterblend-4-18-38-hydroponic-fertilizer-set-2/?attribute_weight=1.5+kg)
2. The reservoir itself was calibrated for volume with markings in increments of 5L till 30L.
3. The solution was prepared for 30L and 5L was stored for topping up later.
4. Harvested rainwater with PPM reading of ~30ppm was used to prepare the solution.
5. For mixing ratios check [here](https://hydroponicseuro.com/mixing-instructions/)
6. The 3 compounds were measured with a precision scale (atleast upto 0.1g) and mixed one after the other.
7. pH up solution was required to keep the pH around 5.5-6.0 for optimal nutrient uptake which was made using a solution of 10g [99% potassium carbonate](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/224519112465?var=523793464566) in 100ml distilled water.
8. pH solution was added drop by drop, stirred and pH measured using the pH meter till the ph was set to optimal levels.

>****NOTE**:** Each compound must be completely dissolved before the next one is added and they should be added in the order Masterblend > Magnesium sulphate > Calcium nitrate
