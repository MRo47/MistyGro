# Preparing nutrient solution

1. Masterblend 4-18-38 was used as the nutrient solution and purchased from [here](https://hydroponicseuro.com/product/masterblend-4-18-38-hydroponic-fertilizer-set-2/?attribute_weight=1.5+kg)
2. The reservoir itself was calibrated for volume with markings in increments of 5L till 30L.
3. The solution was prepared for 30L and 5L was stored for topping up later.
4. For mixing ratios check [here](https://hydroponicseuro.com/mixing-instructions/)
5. The 3 compounds were measured with a precision scale (atleast upto 0.1g) and mixed one after the other.

>****NOTE**:** Each compound must be completely dissolved before the next one is added and they should be added in the order Masterblend > Magnesium sulphate > Calcium nitrate
